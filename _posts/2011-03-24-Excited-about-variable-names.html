I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=musihististhr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882">Clean Code by Bob Martin</a> the other day. Having only read the first few chapters, it's already making a difference not only in how I code, but my whole attitude toward coding.<!--more--> (Oh no, this is sounding like an awful infomercial)

The book starts off with a few simple rules. On the surface, these seem to be dry and quite familiar territory to anyone who has much experience with developing software. "Variable names should be descriptive", "Functions should have a single purpose" etc. But within this advice is a more sweeping message - <em>carefully written code, like well made art, is something you can be proud of</em>. My own viewpoint is shifting from one of merely producing deliverable (and maintainable) goods, to also encompass the construction of something which can be appreciated for its craftmanship.

"Uncle" Bob has, with a few simple rules, injected more fun into coding for me.
