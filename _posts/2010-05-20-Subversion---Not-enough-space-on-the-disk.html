title: Subversion - Not enough space on the disk

<p>A quick tip... </p>Using Subversion (via Tortoise, incidentally), I recently got this error:<br /><pre>svn:</pre><pre>Can't set position pointer in file 'C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\report.tmp':</pre><pre>There is not enough space on the disk.</pre><br />This means you have run out of space on your <b><i>server</i></b>.<br /><br />Sounds straight forward, but it took a while fooling around on the client and <a href="http://bing.com/">binging</a> to find an answer.
