It's release time again!

[Here's the .jar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7c4n6wV4pfPUFUxWk9hbm1PbFk/view?usp=sharing), download it and double click it. ([Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) required).

This one has interactivity, so there's some keys to learn:

* Menus use up, down and enter (Use the "Host game" option to start a game, or choose a friend's game on your LAN)
* Move around with W, A, S, D and the mouse
* Space to jump. Pump the spacebar to fly short distances
* Escape gets your mouse cursor back
* Finally, the tab key switches between walking, flying and seeing an overview

Yes, networking snuck into this release as well. It's a bit clunky, but functional. More on that in a later post.

There's no goal or objective yet, this is just one stepping stone on the way to a full game.
