I just published a new game. Download it for free here:

This is usually where I spout some technical blurb about the project, but there really isn’t much technical here.
“Locked Garden” was made in Unity, and (at least for a simple game like this), there's very little technical work to do.
Pretty much drag-and-drop, write a handful of small scripts to control the behaviour of in game objects and you're done.
I’ve made a few small projects in Unity now, and I’m still amazed at how rapid it is to get from an initial idea to a playable prototype.

Of course, it is possible to do some deep technical work in Unity, the scripting API is very extensive.
But for many games, it’s perfectly reasonable just to leave the vast majority of the game loop and graphics pipeline as they are by default.
