It's download time! [The program (not a game yet) can be grabbed here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7c4n6wV4pfPSk5Xd2dpUVZsVTA). Stick it on your PC or Mac and tap on the .jar file (requires Java).

I've had lots of fun over the last week playing around with algorithms for terrain generation, pretty lighting, 3D stuffs and optimizations. The result is a pretty spinning island generator. Enjoy.
