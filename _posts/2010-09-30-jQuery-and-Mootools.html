Recently, I've taken the time to look into both the jQuery and MooTools Javascript libraries. The similarities and differences between the two have been expanded upon before <a href="http://jqueryvsmootools.com/">in some depth</a>, but I think that a more brief summary is in order.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TKPmXPlbthI/AAAAAAAAADk/QdzjY3UDIdw/s1600/jQuery_logo_color_onwhite.png"><img class="dark" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TKPmXPlbthI/AAAAAAAAADk/QdzjY3UDIdw/s1600/jQuery_logo_color_onwhite.png" border="0" alt="" /></a>jQuery does a great job of making plain HTML richer, especially if you make use of the accompanying <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> library. If your client-side concerns start and end with providing a better user experience for HTML forms,then jQuery is your go-to guy.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TKPniyKjNkI/AAAAAAAAADo/yHpLrszNzBk/s1600/mootools.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TKPniyKjNkI/AAAAAAAAADo/yHpLrszNzBk/s1600/mootools.png" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
On the other hand, you may plan on doing more intensive work, such as a client side application or browser based game for example. MooTools is great for this, especially if you are used to a different Object Oriented language such as Java or C#. The capability to design classes and methods in a familiar manner is an inestimably huge boon when attempting to build a sophisticated, maintainable program. (I never truly felt 'at home' with prototype based programming).

So there it is; jQuery for forms and MooTools for applications.
