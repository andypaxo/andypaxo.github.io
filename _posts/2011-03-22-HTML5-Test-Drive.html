I've read <a href="http://www.manning.com/crowther/">Hello HTML5</a> (or as much of it as is finished), and Mark Pilgrim's excellent <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">Dive Into HTML5</a>. Time to give this a go...

I now have a <a href="https://github.com/andypaxo/Inspection">repository on GitHub</a> for a simple form filling application making use of the <em>local storage</em> and <em>offline application </em>APIs. As of writing, I'm still feeling my way around this stuff, so the code isn't really worth using in any other project, but I hope to clean it up over time.

HTML5 opens up many, many possibilities that were, until recently, the sole domain of installed applications. The future of the web is definitely getting more exciting.
