>I've been reading through Pete Brown's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silverlight-4-Action-Pete-Brown/dp/1935182374?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=musihististhr-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">Silverlight 4&nbsp;in Action</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=musihististhr-20&amp;l=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969&amp;o=1&amp;a=1935182374" style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px !important; padding-left: 0px !important; padding-right: 0px !important; padding-top: 0px !important;" width="1" />. Having only got to the first few chapters, I can't say much about it yet, but it does have a very good introduction to the technology.<br /><br />Tripping and stumbling my way through the process of learning to write Silverlight applications, I have already come across a couple of sticking points. Here's number one:<br /><br /><h2>"I can't attach the debugger to Silverlight"</h2>I like running programs in a debugger. It's not a crutch - it's just more efficient to develop that way. <em>So there</em>. When I first ran my Silverlight application, the process that&nbsp;Visual Studio embarked upon&nbsp;seemed to be something like this:<br /><ol><li>The web server starts</li><li>The debugger attaches</li><li>Firefox starts</li><li style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">The debugger decides that it's had enough, and detaches... goodbye!</li></ol><div align="center"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TLCPWHpM1aI/AAAAAAAAADs/qvfP_lOE52U/s1600/internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox-safari1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" ex="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kIB_McdGwig/TLCPWHpM1aI/AAAAAAAAADs/qvfP_lOE52U/s1600/internet-explorer-mozilla-firefox-safari1.jpg" /></a></div><div style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">The problem is right there in step 3: <em>Firefox</em>. For reasons unknown, the debugger just doesn't seem to get on well with browsers that aren't Internet Explorer. Changing your default browser to IE will fix this. If you don't want to mess with your browser settings, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2364723/how-do-i-set-my-development-web-browser-in-vs2010">there are alternatives</a> (although these days, with IE 8 and 9, using the blue "e" isn't too bad).</div>
