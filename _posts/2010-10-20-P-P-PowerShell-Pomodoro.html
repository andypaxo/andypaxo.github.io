I have some time management issues, don't we all? Lately, I've been trying using the

to overcome the little distractions that can easily scupper a good work day.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a style="text-align: center;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Clearance-60-Minute-Kitchen-Mechanical-Counting/dp/B001S6A8XY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=musihististhr-20&amp;link_code=bil&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=B001S6A8XY&amp;tag=musihististhr-20" alt="(Price/piece)Clearance Sale! 60-Minute Tomato Kitchen Timer, Mechanical Counting Timer, Shower Timer" /></a>
The biggest issue I (and many others) have with implementing the technique is also the central focal point; The <em>timer</em>. A timer is essential... preferably a loud, clanky, ticky, tomato shaped kitchen timer. This just isn't an option in a shared office.
Now, there are plenty of software timers already out there. (There's even a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pomodorotechnique-timer?pli=1">Google group</a> for sharing the timers you've made). But what kind of software alchemist wouldn't make his own?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In time, I may make a Silverlight timer with some capacity for the lists and notes required by the technique. For now, here's a quick PowerShell script to just do the timer part.

&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep 1

}
get-date
