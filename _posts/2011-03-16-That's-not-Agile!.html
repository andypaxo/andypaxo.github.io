<blockquote><em>“We have come to value ... Customer collaboration over contract negotiation”</em></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- The Agile Manifesto<!--more--></p>
Much has been written about Agile, Domain Driven Design and other modern software development methodologies. You can't read very much of this without coming across a foundational common thread... user and customer involvement.

The more teaching on Agile that I read, the more I am convinced <em>if you don't have constant interaction with your users and customers, you are not doing Agile</em>.<em>
