<p>While writing the about the book <a href="http://www.softwarealchemist.net/2010/12/becoming-javascript-ninja-book.html">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a>, I came to a realization. <i>OOP languages help in understanding JavaScript initially, but are damaging in the long term</i>.</p>

<p>Because the concepts from Java, C#, etc. are <i>close</i> to the concepts in JavaScript, they give a developer a 'leg up' when starting to understand the language. However, relying on the understanding that comes from other languages prevents a developer from fully grasping the power of JavaScript. It is, after all, as much a functional language as it is object based. For example:</p>

<ul><li>Methods are <i>somewhat</i> like functions</li>
<li>Scopes are <i>somewhat</i> like closures</li>
<li>Classes are <i>somewhat</i> like prototypes</li>
</ul>

<p>It's just like learning a spoken language; If you want to speak fluently, you need to stop translating from your native tongue and learn to <i>think</i> in a new language.</p>
