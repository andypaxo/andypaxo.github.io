I'm reading <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja </a>by John Resig. I'd strongly recommend to <i>most</i> developers who do anything with the web that they should read this book.<br>
<br>
To be more precise...<br>
<b>Developers who need to read this book:</b><br>
<ul><li>Anyone who has written basic JavaScript, but feels a little uncertainty about the phrases 'closure' or 'prototype'</li>
<li><b> </b>Anyone who writes JavaScript, but relies on a third party library such as jQuery or MooTools</li>
</ul><b>Developers who don't need to read this book:</b><br>
<ul><li>Anyone who hasn't developed a web / JS app (read something more introductory, <i>then</i> this book)</li>
<li>Valerio Proietti</li>
</ul>I've only covered about a third of what has so far been written (covering unit testing, functions, closures and prototypes). But... these fundamentals are of inestimable importance to a developer who has made do with applying knowledge from OO languages to JavaScript.
